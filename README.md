## Motivation
Valentine's day is celebrated yearly on the 14th of February. It is a day when romance takes centre stage and people show their love for each other with accompanying rituals. Specific behaviours and rituals that people often perform are giving gifts, showing affection, or going out for dinner or a romantic getaway [(Close & Zinkhan, 2006)](https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v33/v33_10020.pdf). For overnight stays, Airbnb accommodation is often booked.

Therefore, this study proposes the following research question:

*What is the effect of Valentine's Day on Airbnb listings in Europe?*

We zoom in on several major cities in Europe. This is interesting because not every country celebrates Valentine's Day to the same extent and/or not every city is equally popular. In addition, we look at whether it matters whether Valentine's Day falls on a weekend or not. For example, if Valentine's Day falls on a Monday, people may be less inclined to book an overnight stay than if it falls on a Friday. It is then possible that guests might postpone their overnight stays until the weekend.

This leads to the following sub-questions:
- What is the effect of Valentine's Day on the price of Airbnb listings in 'city'?
- Which type of accommodation is booked more than usual on Valentine's Day in 'city' and by how much?
- Is there a difference in the number of bookings on Airbnb on Valentine's day than any other day in February?
- What is the difference between Valentine's day bookings in 'city A' and 'city B' (different cities in Europe) looking at price/accomodation type? <sub>--> can expand with more cities</sub>
- How does the popularity of Valentine's Day in the city/country influence Airbnb bookings, looking at price/accommodation type? <sub>--> note: find/create a separate dataset for this question to combine with Airbnb data.</sub>

<sub>note: (laatste twee zijn beetje hetzelfde misschien)</sub>

We expect that here would be more demand for Airbnb listings around this holiday. If demand increases, hosts can charge higher prices for their accomodations. Moreover, more accommodations for 2 people are likely to be booked, as couples usually celebrate Valentine's Day.

## Data
The data used in this research project was obtained from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/). The period of the data used is from February (year) - February (year) --> 5 years? (watch out for corona years?) -> since Valentine's day is in middle of feb, look at the weeks before and after, so maybe whole month?

## Method and results
**Method**

As discussed above Data from Inside Airbnb will be used to look at different cities in Europe regarding their Airbnb listings in the month of februari and especially Valentine's Day. The analysis of the Airbnb data will start with the city Amsterdam, and will later expand to doing the same analysis for other cities in Europe. --> note: for other cities definetely include city of love: Paris

Analysis: 

Variables:

DV: price and accomodation type/characteristics
