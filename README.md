# The effect of Valentine's Day on Airbnb listings
This research project is part of the [Data Preparation and Workflow Management (dPrep)](https://dprep.hannesdatta.com/) course at Tilburg University. The research answers the following research question:

How does Valentine's Day affect the price and accommodation type of Airbnb listings?

## Motivation
Valentine's day is celebrated yearly on 14 February. It is a day when romance takes centre stage and people show their love for each other with accompanying rituals. Specific behaviours and rituals that people often perform are giving gifts, showing affection, or going out for dinner or a romantic getaway [(Close & Zinkhan, 2006)](https://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v33/v33_10020.pdf). Consequently, for overnight stays, Airbnb accommodation is often booked. It therefore sounds reasonable that there would be more demand for Airbnb listings around this holiday. If demand increases, hosts can charge higher prices for their accomodations. Moreover, more accommodations for 2 people are likely to be booked, as couples usually celebrate Valentine's Day.

Based on the aformentioned, the following research question was proposed:
'How does Valentine's Day affect the price and accommodation type of Airbnb listings?'

Furthermore, we distinguish between different cities in Europe, as not every country celebrates Valentine's Day to the same extent and/or not every city is equally popular. In addition, we look at whether it matters whether Valentine's Day falls on a weekend or not. For example, if Valentine's Day falls on a Monday, people may be less inclined to book an overnight stay than if it falls on a Friday. It is then possible that guests might postpone their overnight stays until the weekend. As a result, we will look at data from different years.

Besides the research question there will be some subquestions that will be investigated in order to give a better overview and analysis to answer the main question.
These subquestions are:
- What is the effect of Valentine's Day on the price of Airbnb listings in 'city'?
- What type of accomodation is booked more than usual on Valentine's day in 'city' and by how much? 
- Is there a difference in the number of bookings on Airbnb on Valentine's day than any other day in februari?
- What is the difference between Valentine's day bookings in 'city A' and 'city B' (different cities in Europe) looking at price/accomodation type? --> can expand with more cities
- What is the effect of the city/country's Valentine's popularity on the Airbnb listings, looking at price/accomodation type? ---> note: look for/make separate dataset for this question to combine with Airbnb data

note: (laatste twee zijn beetje hetzelfde misschien)
note: Main question can also be more general: What is the effect of Valentine's Day on Airbnb listings (in Europe's (biggest) cities)? --> then could add other subquestions

## Data
The data used in this research project was obtained from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/). The period of the data used is ... --> month februari over different (5?) years? (watch out for corona years?) -> since Valentine's day is in middle of feb

## Method and results
**Method**
As discussed above Data from Inside Airbnb will be used to look at different cities in Europe regarding their Airbnb listings in the month of februari and especially Valentine's Day. The analysis of the Airbnb data will start with the city Amsterdam, and will later expand to doing the same analysis for other cities in Europe. --> note: for other cities definetely include city of love: Paris
